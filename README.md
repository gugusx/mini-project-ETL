# Mini-Project: ETL  

## Introduction  

This project demonstrates a simple **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline**, a fundamental concept in data engineering. The ETL process involves:  

- **Extracting** data from a source.  
- **Transforming** the data (e.g., cleaning, filtering, etc).  
- **Loading** the processed data into a target destination (e.g., database, data warehouse, another file).  

This mini-project is designed for practice and learning purposes, providing a hands-on approach to working with ETL workflows using Python.
